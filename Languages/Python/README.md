# Python

## Installation

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution): free Python distribution from Continuum Analytics that includes SymPy, Matplotlib, IPython, NumPy, and many more useful packages for scientific computing.
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)

### Libraries

* [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html): Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda update sympy
```

* [SciPy](https://scipy.org): provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install scipy
```

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org): offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install numpy
```

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install pandas
```
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install matplotlib
```

* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install plotly
```

* [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org): community effort to develop a common core package for Astronomy in Python and foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages.

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install astropy
```

* [Sunpy](https://sunpy.org): free and open-source solar data analysis environment for Python. Sunpy is part of the wider ecosystem of scientific Python packages for solar physics. 

**Install with Anaconda:**

```terminal
conda install sunpy
```

* [NetworkX](https://networkx.org): Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

**Install with Anaconda:**
